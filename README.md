# SI667-Assignment-3

This is the updated books.csv in .xlsx format. Not everything has been changed, but the Book ID and Cost_Denom_ID were removed. 
The Binding ID was replaced from number values to the actual binding material. A similar change happened with the Origin ID column from ID number to the location name.
For the actual data project changes would also be made to the way the Full_Cost, Cost_US, and Cost_UK columns to make them more legible. 
The ReadMe file on the GitHub repository would be updated to give more context for the data as well.
